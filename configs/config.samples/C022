This is the Exim configuration file of a machine which delivers mail to several
local domains, where the mail is delivered locally, several hairy domains,
handled as described below, and a half-virtual domain, which is first processed
by its special alias file, then processed as other local domains (including the
processing by the global alias file).

This contribution consists of a number of files that are in the tar archive 
C022.tar, which unpacks into a directory called "virtual". See the README file 
therein for an explanation of the configuration.
 
This is the updated virtual domain handling for Exim 4.  The
main changes are:

1. Now there's the alias file admin.raw for privileged aliases
   (such as Postmaster).  It is processed earlier than
   domain-specific files.  The domain is not preserved on
   redirection.

2. <DOMAIN>.rewrite.raw is gone, and <DOMAIN>.aliases.raw is
   renamed to <DOMAIN>.raw.  The functionality was put into
   entries with keys ending with a '+', and the data are allowed
   to have no domain (which made the rewrite rule slightly more
   complicated).
