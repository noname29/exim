I've been seeing a whole bunch of IPs that send me spam / virus mail and 
HELOing as one of my own IPs, or as HELO one.of.my.own.domains (or maybe 
HELO primary_hostname)

On the other hand, I have users relaying through my box with AUTH, using 
mozilla, which HELO's as "HELO hserus.net" if a hserus.net user relays.

Here's something to stop this stuff - in acl_check_rcpt:

[snippet in exim configure file]

  accept  hosts = :

  # Accept all authenticated senders
  accept  authenticated = *

  # Spam control

  # Be polite and say HELO. Reject anything from hosts that havn't given
  # a valid HELO/EHLO to us.
  deny condition = ${if \
    or{{!def:sender_helo_name}{eq{$sender_helo_name}{}}}{yes}{no}}
           message = RFCs mandate HELO/EHLO before mail can be sent

  # Forged hostname - HELOs as my own hostname or domain
  deny	message = Forged hostname detected in HELO: $sender_helo_name
	hosts	= !+relay_from_hosts
	log_message = Forged hostname detected in HELO: \
	$sender_helo_name
	condition = ${lookup {$sender_helo_name} \
		lsearch{/usr/local/etc/exim/local_domains}{yes}{no}}

  # Forged hostname -HELOs as one of my own IPs
  deny message = Forged IP detected in HELO: $sender_helo_name
       hosts = !+relay_from_hosts
       log_message = Forged IP detected in HELO: $sender_helo_name
       condition = ${if \
	  eq{$sender_helo_name}{$interface_address}{yes}{no}}

[end snippet]
