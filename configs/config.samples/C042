Hello,

Since Exim 4 configuration needed to get Mailman work differs a little
bit from Exim 3 and since I still haven't seen a "recipe" for Mailman
with Exim 4, I'm providing my configuration (based heavily on
http://www.exim.org/howto/mailman.html).

Following goes into main config settings:

domainlist lists_domains = lists.krot.org
MAILMAN_HOME=/local/lists
MAILMAN_WRAP=MAILMAN_HOME/mail/wrapper
MAILMAN_UID=mailman
MAILMAN_GID=exim


Following routers are defined:

list_owner:
    driver = redirect
    domains = +lists_domains
    require_files = MAILMAN_HOME/lists/$local_part/config.db
    local_part_suffix = -owner
    data = ${lc:$local_part}-admin@$domain

owner_list:
    driver = redirect
    domains = +lists_domains
    require_files = MAILMAN_HOME/lists/$local_part/config.db
    local_part_prefix = owner-
    data = ${lc:$local_part}-admin@$domain

list_admin:
    driver = accept
    domains = +lists_domains
    require_files = MAILMAN_HOME/lists/$local_part/config.db
    local_part_suffix = -admin
    transport = list_admin

list_request:
    driver = accept
    domains = +lists_domains
    require_files = MAILMAN_HOME/lists/$local_part/config.db
    local_part_suffix = -request
    transport = list_request

list:
    driver = accept
    domains = +lists_domains
    require_files = MAILMAN_HOME/lists/$local_part/config.db
    transport = list


And these transports are needed:

list_admin:
    driver = pipe
    command = MAILMAN_WRAP mailowner ${lc:$local_part}
    current_directory = MAILMAN_HOME
    home_directory = MAILMAN_HOME
    user = MAILMAN_UID
    group = MAILMAN_GID

list_request:
    driver = pipe
    command = MAILMAN_WRAP mailcmd ${lc:$local_part}
    current_directory = MAILMAN_HOME
    home_directory = MAILMAN_HOME
    user = MAILMAN_UID
    group = MAILMAN_GID

list:
    driver = pipe
    command = MAILMAN_WRAP post ${lc:$local_part}
    current_directory = MAILMAN_HOME
    home_directory = MAILMAN_HOME
    user = MAILMAN_UID
    group = MAILMAN_GID

Mailman was configured --with-mail-gid=exim.
