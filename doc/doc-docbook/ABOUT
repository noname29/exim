Exim repository: doc/doc-docbook
--------------------------------

This directory contains the AsciiDoc and DocBook sources for the Exim
specification and the filter description. It also contains a Makefile and all
the scripts, stylesheets, etc. that are used to create the distributed
renditions of the documents. This way of creating the documentation was
introduced for release 4.60.

The file HowItWorks.txt explains the processes by which the distributed
renditions are created. It also contains a list of the files in this directory
and what they all contain.
