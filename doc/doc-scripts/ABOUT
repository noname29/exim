Exim repository: doc/doc-scripts
--------------------------------

This directory contains various scripts that are used to build the distributed
documentation from its SGCAL source files. This method of maintaining the
documentation was used up to and including release 4.50 of Exim. There is also
a script for building the FAQ from its source. This is still (June 2005)
current, but may be superseded in due course.
