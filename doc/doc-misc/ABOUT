Exim repository: doc/doc-misc
-----------------------------

This directory contains some miscellaneous documentation files that do not form 
part of Exim distributions, but are related to its maintenance and development.
Those whose names start with "Ext-" are external documents that won't be 
modified (and hence have no local CVS Ids).
