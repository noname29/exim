# recipient and host defer interactions
# In this test, the primary host (normal IP address) defers the recipient, and
# the secondary host (loopback address) defers the connection.
#
#XXX the test is relying on one-second accuracy, which is too tight.
# The measured time is only one-second precision, so certain to sometime
# straddle a boundary, even ignoring scheduling and I/O-wait issues.
# Consider a factor of (?) two, in the retry section of the conf/ file
# and +1 /2 after the diff operation (runtest:463).
