# "A" should go throuugh as one MAIL FROM message, B,E,F as a second, C,D
# as a third - due to the server responses.  Note that the client logging
# gets overlapped; look at the server's id= logged with the 250 by the client.

# Repeat without pipelining, just as a baseline check.
# The optimisation, that does another message attempt immediately on the open
# connection, is only there for the pipelined case at present.  So we must
# kick the message three times for three separate connections.
# (A possible enhancement, if anyone cares.  "first_addr" in
# smtp_deliver/sync_responses is the key).
