# This is a little perl script that adjusts the "received" time in a -H file,
# so that retry timeouts etc can be more easily tested. Its arguments are:
#
# (1) The number of the message on the queue whose time is to be adjusted; 1 
#     for the first message, 2 for the second, etc.
#
# (2) A positive or negative number by which to adjust the received time.
