; This is a testing zone file for use when testing DNS handling in Exim. This
; is a fake zone of no real use. The zone name is
; test.ex. This file is passed through the substitution mechanism before being
; used by the fakens auxiliary program. This inserts the actual IP addresses
; of the local host into the zone.

; NOTE (1): apart from ::1, IPv6 addresses must always have 8 components. Do
; not abbreviate them by using the :: feature. Leading zeros in components may,
; however, be omitted.

; NOTE (2): the fakens program is very simple and assumes that the buffer into
; which is puts the response is always going to be big enough. In other words,
; the expectation is for just a few RRs for each query.

; NOTE (3): the top-level networks for testing addresses are parameterized by
; the use of V4NET and V6NET. These networks should be such that no real
; host ever uses them.
;
; Several prefixes may be used, see the source in src/fakens.c for a complete list
; and description.
