; This is a testing reverse zone file for use when testing DNS handling in
; Exim. This is a fake zone of no real use - hence no SOA record. The zone name
; is 10.in-addr.arpa. This file is passed through the substitution mechanism
; before being used by the fakens auxiliary program, though in fact there is
; nothing to substitute.

; This zone exists to handle reverse lookups for the host with a huge number of
; IP addresses that get manufactured by the fake_gethostbyname() function in
; Exim. They are hard-wired to use the 10.250.0.0/16 network. Apart from that
; one use, the test suite shouldn't be using that network, so everything else
; is passed on to res_search(). The next line triggers this action.
