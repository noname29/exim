### Two recipients, different domains through same DANE MX host
### Two recipients: 1st: DANE, 2nd no-DANE, SNI is expected for the 1st only
### One recipient to MX whith a secure CNAME chain, SNI should use CNAME target
### Same, but to MX whith a insecure CNAME chain, should fail, no SNI expected
### Same, but to MX whith a insecure CNAME chain, should pass, no SNI expected
### Two messages, 1st secure CHAIN, 2nd with insecure chain, 1st must use DANE, but 2nd
### Two messages, 1st insecure CHAIN, 2nd with secure chain, 1st must not use DANE, but 2nd
### Two messages, 1st secure CHAIN, 2nd with insecure chain, 1st must use DANE, 2nd fail
### Two messages, 1st insecure CHAIN, 2nd with secure chain, 1st must fail, 2nd pass
