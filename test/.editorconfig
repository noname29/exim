# Common text-editor configuration for Exim
# http://editorconfig.org/
#
# This system sets attributes of the code results of editing, not of
# how you set up the editor to do some helpful things for you.  It's
# deliberately limited, to be non-contentious and avoid bloat.
#
# In this file, we'll also collect _suggestions_ for text editor configs
# for various text editors, to better work with what passes for a common
# style in Exim.  Use, or don't use, those as you see fit.
